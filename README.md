<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

Let me tell you a quick summary about my background.  

I'm Kevin Alejandrino and I'm a Front-End Developer based in California. I graduated with a Computer Science degree in Fall 2019 at California State University, Sacramento. 

I've dealt with a major setback and stop programming for about a year. But this year, motivated and committed as ever I started my developer journey 
following the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. Over the past few weeks, I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, working with small projects
on the side. Now,  

🌱 I’m currently working with [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) projects to improve my basic skills on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

🛠️ I'm currently learning [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) in Udemy. 

💞️ If we have the same interest and goals, please don't hesistate to reach me and we can collaborate on some interesting projects and learn  
&nbsp;&emsp; from each other.

🖥️ Tools/Languages: GitHub / VS Code / HTML / CSS / Sass / JS / React  

⏲️ My goal is to become a full-stack developer and for me to do that, I want to learn more about web technologies. To improved in  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;front-end development and provide the most efficient code there is.  

🎮 In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games, hiking (if invited by someone) and working out. Want to explore skiing/surfing.
