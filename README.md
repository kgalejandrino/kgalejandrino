<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

Let me tell you a quick summary about my background.  

I'm Kevin Alejandrino and I'm a Front-End Developer based in California. I graduated with a Computer Science degree in Fall 2019 at California State University, Sacramento. 

While studying, I really never had a clear goal on what I wanted to do after college. I explored different areas of Computer Science like game design, forensics and databases classes. However, when I was doing my senior project I fell inlove with the whole development process and that's when I started my developer journey. I took a break for about a year after graduation and beginning of 2021 I decided to learn the basics of web development again. I started with the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum and over the past few weeks, I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React working with small projects on the side.   

🌱 I'm currently attending the [Bay Valley Tech](https://www.bayvalleytech.com/about) coding program and learn more about web development and explore Angular, TypeScript and NodeJs.

🛠️ I'm also reviewing [React - The complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) in Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. 

💞️ If we have the same interest and goals, please don't hesistate to reach me and we can collaborate on some interesting projects and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;learn from each other.

🖥️ Tools/Languages: GitHub / VS Code / HTML / CSS / Sass / JS / React  

⏲️ My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and to learn more about new web technologies. But right now, my focus is to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;improve my front-end development skills and be able to provide the most efficient code there is. 

🎮 In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games, working out & learning about investing in stocks. Want to explore skiing/surfing.
