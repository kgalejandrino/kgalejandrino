<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

I'm Kevin Alejandrino and I have about a year of experience working as an Automation Engineer. Having been able to work as a tester, my curiousity has grown of what it's like to be part of the development team. This year (2023), I wanted to pick up where I left off in learning about full-stack development. I'm currently learning [React - The complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) in Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. Also, I'm working on my first React project - https://kgalejandrino.github.io/react-ecommerce-webapp/#/.
